Distribution of minor affixes does not depend on the type of artifacts.
Minor affix cannot be the same as the main affix.
By enhancing an artifact to level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, one minor affix
would be rolled and increased. If an artifact has less than 4 minor affixes,
a new minor affix would be rolled, which cannot confict with existing
main/minor affixes and obeys the minor affix distribution. If an artifact
has exactly 4 minor affixes, one of the 4 minor affix would be chosen
with equal probability. One increment of a minor affix takes one of 4
possible values with equal probability, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% of the
maximum value.

Distribution of minor affixes is:

| Minor affix       | Pick weight | Max value |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| HP                | 6           | 298.75    |
| ATK               | 6           | 19.45     |
| DEF               | 6           | 23.15     |
| HP%               | 4           | 0.0583    |
| ATK%              | 4           | 0.0583    |
| DEF%              | 4           | 0.0729    |
| Elemental Mastery | 4           | 23.31     |
| Energy Recharge%  | 4           | 0.0648    |
| Crit Rate%        | 3           | 0.0389    |
| Crit DMG%         | 3           | 0.0777    |

## Artifact potential

> In this section, only rarity 5 artifacts are considered.

Three statistics are considered important to the evaluation of an artifact's
potential: **expected affix number**, **maximum affix number** and
**minimum affix number**. Here the "affix" refers toe minor affixes
because main affixes are fixed. As minor affix increment value takes
4 possible values, the affix number of a minor affix is defined to be the
ratio of its value divided by the maxnimum one-time increment of this
minor affix. The affix number of an artifact is defined to be an weighted
sum of each minor affix number, given the weight of each minor affix customed
by users. This is because certain minor affixes are considered useless while
others are usually more valuable. Weight of a minor affix must be between
0 and 1.
